This is the official implementation of paper - [RobustL2S: Speaker-Specific Lip-to-Speech Synthesis exploiting Self-Supervised Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01233), accepted in APSIPA 2023. 

The steps to be followed are mentioned in `run.sh` file. It is written for Chemistry Lip2Wav dataset.

The code also includes [AV-HuBERT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/av_hubert) repository, which is used for video-preprocessing and video-feature extraction.
